# Grants

Welcome to the Grants folder! This folder is dedicated to managing grant-related information for our Fab Lab.

## Usage

- Create subfolders or markdown files to organize grant applications, status tracking, and accepted grants.
- Use individual folders or files to store relevant documents, such as proposals, budgets, and supporting materials.
- Maintain a tracking system to update the status of each grant application (submitted, pending, accepted, rejected) and store relevant information.

Feel free to customize the organization and structure within this folder to best suit our grant management needs.

For more information on the overall usage and guidelines of the Fab Lab repository, refer to the main [README](README.md) file in the root directory.

Let's track and manage our grant applications effectively!
