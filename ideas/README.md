# Ideas

Welcome to the Ideas folder! This folder is dedicated to capturing and analyzing ideas within our Fab Lab. It serves as a repository for brainstorming sessions, innovation, and future planning.

## Usage

- Create separate markdown files or subfolders to organize different categories or specific ideas.
- Use the files to record and document various ideas that arise within the Fab Lab.
- Include detailed information about each idea, such as descriptions, potential impact, feasibility, and assigned responsible parties.
- Regularly review and analyze the ideas to identify opportunities for implementation and improvement.

Feel free to customize the organization and structure within this folder to best suit our idea management needs.

For more information on the overall usage and guidelines of the Fab Lab repository, refer to the main README file in the root directory.
