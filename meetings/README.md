# Meetings

Welcome to the Meetings folder! This folder is dedicated to storing meeting-related information for our Fab Lab.

## Usage

- Create subfolders for each meeting, named after the date or topic.
- Within each subfolder, include markdown files for meeting agendas, minutes, and any supporting documents.
- Ensure that all relevant meeting materials are properly documented and organized.

Feel free to customize the organization and structure within this folder to best suit our meeting management requirements.

For more information on the overall usage and guidelines of the Fab Lab repository, refer to the main README file in the root directory.

Let's have productive and well-documented meetings in our Fab Lab!
