# Miscellaneous

Welcome to the Miscellaneous folder! This folder is for storing files and items that don't fit into other categories in our Fab Lab.

## Usage

- Use this folder to store temporary files, ad-hoc notes, or other miscellaneous items that don't have a specific place yet.
- Regularly review and organize the contents of this folder to ensure a tidy repository.
- Move files to appropriate folders as needed when they find their proper place.

Feel free to customize the organization and structure within this folder to best suit our miscellaneous item management needs.

For more information on the overall usage and guidelines of the Fab Lab repository, refer to the main README file in the root directory.

Let's keep our repository tidy and organized, even for miscellaneous items!
