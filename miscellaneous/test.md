We are tring to add diagrams in markdown

![svgtest](../miscellaneous/test.svg)

We figured we can use draw.io both online and as an extention with vs code.
That works very well becouse it has a clear format(.drawio) code and can also export in .svg that is easy to include in markdown and shows a 
preview on git hub.

This is great to creatie varius diagrams.
