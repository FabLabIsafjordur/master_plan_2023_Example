# Operations

Welcome to the Operations folder! This folder is dedicated to managing lists and tasks related to daily operations in our Fab Lab.

## Usage

- Create markdown files or subfolders to organize different categories or specific tasks.
- Use the files to maintain to-do lists, checklists, or reminders for various operational activities.
- Regularly update and mark off completed tasks to ensure smooth functioning of the Fab Lab.

Feel free to customize the organization and structure within this folder to best suit our operational needs.

For more information on the overall usage and guidelines of the Fab Lab repository, refer to the main [README](README.md) file in the root directory.

Let's keep our operations running efficiently and effectively!
