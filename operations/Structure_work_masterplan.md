# Structure work for the master plan repo on github for Fab Lab Isa

To make sence what would be the best and most intuitive repo structure for the lab we used chat gpt to give some suggestion and make the task list below.

This is what we asked it to do.

> make a repo structure on GitHub that makes sense for managing a Fab Lab. Here are some points.
> 
> -It's private and for staff and interns only
> - It should be simple and I don't want to many empty folders
> - Main purpose would be to synchronize, have overview, plan and keep track of thoughts and ideas that come up.
> - it should be fast and efficient to take notes and we would like to stick to markdown files as much as possible for a flexible work environment.
